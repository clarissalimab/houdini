# Objective
The test goals. e.g.: Evaluate the account customizations feature and website information placement.

# Requirements

## Environment
What is the environment that should be tested and how it should be prepared. e.g.: The test needs to run in the pre-2.0 version of the project and a browser with the main page opened.

## User profile
Describe the target users you are looking for the test. e.g.: A user that has already used other projects similar to Houdini.

## Facilitator
What the facilitator should be familiar with to run the tests. e.g.: The facilitator needs to understand the user journey to donate to a project.

# Test design
## Tasks
A list of tasks that the user has to perform. e.g.:

* Change profile information.
* Discover the project features.

## Scenarios
A list of scenarios for the user to perform the tasks. They should put the user in a context and not give specific hints about what you want the user to do. e.g.:

1. You received an e-mail asking to update your personal information because your complete name is incorrect. Please, look for this option in the application.
2. When you were navigating through the application, you realized how awesome it is and you want to discover what else you can do with it. Can you find out what else the application does?
